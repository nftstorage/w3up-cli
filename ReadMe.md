### Registration Commands:

##### Registration

Before you can use most of the commands with the w3up-cli you need to generate an id and register that identity. This is handled in 2 steps:

1. `w3up id`
2. `w3up register you@example.com`

```sh
w3up id
```

Generate your identity.
Generates the public and private key pairs necessary to work with the underlying [UCAN ](https://ucan.xyz/) system.

```sh
w3up register
```

Register your identity.
After you've generated an identity, you need to register it with the w3up service. You'll be sent an email with a code you paste into the command line when prompted. If the code matches what the service expects, you're fully registered and can use all the other commands.

## Run tests

yarn run test
